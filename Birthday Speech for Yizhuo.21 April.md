## "君子不立危墙之下"，“边界意识”，“知道自己的能力边界，在边界内做事。”

May I have your attention please? Today is my Son - XU Yizhuo's Year 1 birthday. We are so glad to have every one of you here. Thank you for comming and the lovely presents.  He is a great kid. He has all the good things that I have ever imagined for a boy. I cannot be any more satisfied and grateful. So it is really sweet to have so many friends and your kids to celebrate this special moment. I hope you all enjoy yourself today. 

为了让小朋友们也参与进来，我想再用中文讲述一遍。今天谢谢所有的大朋友和小朋友能来参加徐一濯小朋友的生日Party。他还这么小，却能够得到大家的祝福和礼物，意义非凡。一濯是个很乖的宝宝，他身上拥有了我所能想到的一个孩子可以拥有的最好的品质。而今天能够和这么多的大朋友、小朋友一起庆祝一濯的生日趴，也让我觉得异常温馨。
